## Features

- User login: Registered users can log in using their username and password.
- Session management: User sessions are managed using Flask's session functionality.
- Password hashing: User passwords are hashed using Flask-Bcrypt before being stored in the database.
- MongoDB integration: MongoDB is used as the backend database for storing user data and login sessions.
